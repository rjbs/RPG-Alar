Status: Stolen by purple spirit

Carus the Spiteful hired the gang to track down Passu Pasillus, give him a
sound thrashing, and recover Carus's stolen truncheon, which he was famous for
always carrying.  Although Passu was eventually captured outside his home town
of Binia, one of his summoned spirits ran off with the truncheon.
