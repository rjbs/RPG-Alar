Status: Surrendered to angry Nexan

Calliope lifted this dagger from the house of Mariava the antiquarian.  It
turns the wielder blue, with strange moving shapes on his or her skin.  Helga
originally promised to buy it for 2 gc, but later reneged when she learned it
didn't seem to have any other known properties.

When pursued by an angry Nexan outside the Burning Dog, Calliope eventually
dropped the knife and ran away.
