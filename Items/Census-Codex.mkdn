Status: At the Gang's Lair

Calliope stole this codex from Mariava's house.  Its pages are covered in small
writing, listing names, grouped by cities.  Over time, names come and go from
the pages.  Several parts of the book are blurred beyond recognition.

The book is marked with the insignia of the Imperial Bureau of Census and
Taxation.
