Equidistant from [House Gessix](08-15.mkdn), the Philosopher's Quarter, and the
heart of the Vorican ghetto, this area is quite eclectic.  There are taverns,
shops, private businesses, and quite a few dwellings.

### The Dirty Red Table

This tavern is the party's residence and base of operations.  It's named for
the large red table that serves as the place of honor.  It's perennially
reserved for Kethwek and his cohorts.
