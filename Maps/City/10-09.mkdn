## The Forum of the Mad

Technically the Forum of the Plazii, this forum is open to anyone who wants to
speak, unlike many other public fora, which have strict rules for eligibility.
It is known as a gathering point for crackpots and weirdos.

The surrounding neighborhood is calm and residential, with a few open-air
markets and some other small shops.

## Mariava's House

Mariava lives in a small two-floor home just south of the forum of the mad.
