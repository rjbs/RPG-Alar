# Argo

Argo (of the Scales, of the Ivory Throne, Firstborn, Fortunemaker, Wavebringer)
is widely honored by the many sailors and dockworkers in Alar, though he has no
great temple.  By most of the citizens, he is known only as the father of the
Three Brothers.  Priests of Argo wear long blue and white robes and carry long
silver-tipped harpoons â€“ they are among the few groups permitted to bear arms 
in the city.  They are known for their great personal integrity, their vows    
against idle speech, and the great austerity of their order.
