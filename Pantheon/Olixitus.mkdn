# Olixitus

Olixitus (of the Abacus, the Chaste, the Unerring, the Unannounced,
the Unwelcome, Pale-faced) is the son of Enoriaster by the daughter of
Lanas.  For generations, Olixitus was a fairly obscure deity, often
known only as an undescribed god mentioned in epics.  He enjoyed
somewhat greater favor in Alar, where the large academic community
created greater interest in this patron of mathematicians and
numerologists.  In Casta, however, the priesthood of Olixitus was
given charge of the imperial accountancy and census.  In the eyes of
the average citizen, this forever married the priesthood with the
ever-unwelcome tax collector.  The priesthood is, even in Alar,
dominated by the Castaigne order of bookkeepers and census-takers, but
there are still remnants of the old cult of Olixitus of the Abacus in
the cityâ€™s academic quarters.  Like their god, priests of Olixitus may
never marry.  They must pay a fifth of their earnings to the temple,
but pay no other taxes.  Priests of Olixitus can be easily identified
by the tattoos they wear on their face, marking them as permanent
assets of the order.

## Divine Blessing

The "Divine Blessing" power available to Priests lets them provide a +2 bonus
to one of several traits, depending on their deity, for several hours.

For Olixitus, the traits that Tilton can choose from are:

* Danger Evasion
* Mystic Fortitude
* Personal Charisma

## Divine Gift

The "Divine Gift" is something like a ramped up Divine Blessing.  It does only
one thing, but does it much more powerfully.  Invoking Olixitus's Divine Gift
grants the gift of Presence: The character automatically succeeds at all Mystic
Fortitude and Personal Charisma rolls.
